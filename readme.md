# Cardano NFT Bulk Purchaser

This tool is used to purchase Cardano NFT drops from multiple wallets using the cardano-cli, to allow for rapid purchases in high-demand drops.

The tool assumes that the CNFT drop uses or allows multiple purchases sent to a single address and that the cost of each CNFT is known before the drop.

This tool will leverage the cardano-cli.exe which ships with the Daedalus wallet, and communicates to the blockchain using the cardano-node.exe process which is executed when the Daedalus wallet is running. Please ensure Daedalus is executing before attempting to use this tool.

## Modules

This tool has 4 modes: [Build, Verify, Send, Redeem].

### Build

The `Build` module creates N new addresses and payment keys which can be used for purchasing CNFT tokens. Make sure to fund each address with a single UTXO covering the cost of the CNFT, plus a few extra ADA to cover transaction fees for sending and redeeming.

### Verify

The `Verify` module checks the current contents of each generated address for manual verification purposes, and caches the first UTXO to disk to ensure it can be sent as fast as possible.

### Send

The `Send` module will send `X` ADA from each generated wallet to the specified receiver wallet. This module will be used to purchase the CNFT.

### BulkSend

The `BulkSend` module will send `X` \* `N` ADA from a single generated wallet to the specified bulkreceiver wallet. This module can be used to purchase CNFTs by sending multple output-transactions from a single wallet.

### Redeem

The `Redeem` module will extract all ADA and every CNFT, and send it back to the specified wallet.

## Arguments

`-count`: The number of wallets and addresses to [Build, Verify, Send, Redeem] from.

`-build`: Set the build flag to execute the `Build` module.

`-verify`: Set the verify flag to execute the `Verify` module.

`-cost`: The price in ADA that the `Send` module will send to the `-receiver` address.

`-receiver`: The address ADA is sent to when executing the `Send` module.

`-bulkcost`: The price in ADA that the `BulkSend` module will send to the `-bulkreceiver` address in each output transaction.

`-bulkreceiver`: The address ADA is sent to when executing the `BulkSend` module.

`-wallet`: The address ADA and CNFTs are sent to when executing the `Redeem` module.

`-safemode`: Set the `Send` or `Receive` mode to run in safety mode, prompting for approval before sending transactions. This will allow for extra time to double-check the command-line arguments to ensure ADA is sent to the correct location.

## Examples

--- Build 3 wallets ---

```
.\purchase.ps1 -count 3 -build

Wallet Address 1: addr1aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wallet Address 2: addr1aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab
Wallet Address 3: addr1aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac
What is the cost in ADA for the NFT mint?: 1
It is recommended to send at least 3 ADA to each wallet in order to cover transaction costs of sending and redeeming all assets.
